Mininet Examples

These examples are intended to help you get started using Mininet via its
Python API.


linearbandwidth.py

This example shows how to create a custom topology programatically
by subclassing Topo, and how to run a series of tests on it.

scratchnet.py, scratchnetuser.py

These two examples demonstrate how to create a network by using the lowest-
level Mininet functions. Generally the higher-level API is easier to use,
but scratchnet shows what is going on behind the scenes.

udpbwtest.py

This example shows how to run a test across an entire network, and monitor
the output of a set of hosts in real time.
